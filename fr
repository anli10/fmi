*The awesome and contest winning Freya project*

<title> Automatic greenhouse </title>

The project consists in a fully automatic/ed greenhouse meant to grow 'plants' faster and optimize energy consumption

The project will be able to:

	*monitorize environmental parameters such as
		-soil humidity
		-temperature
		-lighting
		Bonus: rain sensor

	*gather data and regularily graph it

	*regulate the environment parameters:
		-water the plant
		-heat the greenhouse interior
		-ventilation
		-periodically adjust inner humidity

	*fill the water tank everytime it rains (raindrops sensor used)


Preliminary requirements:
	-one servomotor
	-2 stepper motors
	-miniature water pump
	-2 relay module 
	-temperatiure sensor (DS18B20) OK
	-heating resistor OK
	-soil humidity sensor OK
	-water level sensor OK
	-raindrops sensor OK
	-fan OK
	


BONUS: - the greenhouse will be able to work with voice commands
	- the greenhouse will be able to conver/uncover itself
	- materials: acrilic glass

FAR BONUS: -web interface with all the controls + graph display (MOST IMPORTANT)
